### Quick Start

New instructions coming soon.

start up a hardhat test node

```
npm install
npx hardhat node
```

new terminal tab to deploy the contract

```
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Things that I keep forgetting

When you call `_mint` you pass the tokenId, so as long as tokenId and the index within the array are the same, there really isn't any problem or need for functions in enumerable like `getIdAtIndex`...

we should be fine.
